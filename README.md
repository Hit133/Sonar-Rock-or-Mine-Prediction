# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project is a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a sonar signal is coming from a rock or a mine.  
It uses Logistic Regression and basic Python libraries to analyze sonar data and classify the signals effectively.

---

## Project Overview

The Sonar dataset consists of signals bounced off various surfaces under the sea — either metal cylinders (mines) or rocks.  
The goal is to train a simple classification model that can identify the source based on the reflected sonar signal values.

## Files Included

sonar.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete model building, training, and prediction steps  
sonar.csv - Dataset used for model training and testing

---

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python (Core language)
- NumPy – For numerical operations
- Pandas – For handling and processing the dataset
- Matplotlib (optional) – For visualizing data (if used)

Note: The model uses a manual Logistic Regression implementation with train-test split.  
No external machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn are used.
